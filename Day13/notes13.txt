File commands

FILE* fopen(char* filename, char* mode)
mode “r” opens file for reading
mode “r+” opens the file for read/write
mode “w” rewrite
mode “w+” same as “w” but we can read as well
mode “a” stream is positioned at the end of the file
mode “a+” read/write, stream is positioned at the end of the file

man fopen has all the answers

int fputc (int c, FILE* file) → returns and int which is the charcode of the symbol that has just been 					  written
int fputs(const char* s, FILE* file) → returns int, positive number if writing was a success and EOF if 						   writing was unsuccesful
char* fgets(char str*,int size, FILE* f)

int fclose (FILE* f) → closes the file and returns 0 if successufl and EOF if unsuccesful
